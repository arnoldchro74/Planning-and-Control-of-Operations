Con la autoregresión se toman en cuenta los valores anteriores que se usaron para pronósticar y se emplea la regresión para modelar los resultados anteriores para predecir el siguiente valor. La integración se refiere a que los datos poseen estacionariedad, es decir, que sus propiedades estadísticas se mantienen en el tiempo alrededor de una media y una desviación estándar. El Promedio Móvil se enfoca en utilizar las predicciones y errores anteriores, promediarlas y estas hacerlas parte del pronóstico del siguiente valor.\n","\n","**Nota:** La estructura matemática de este modelo es más compleja que los anteriores pronósticos y en este colab el enfoque será solo utilizar librerias para realizar las predicciones. En cursos de Machine Learning y Big Data se profundiza en el modelo matemático."],"metadata":{"id":"zKdSGcSabTEF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Se instala el método\n","!pip install
